# Modern & Minimal
## Inventory Management Application
This is a react application for a clothing store to manage their products and sales. Bootstrap CSS framework is used to style the website. Which give user a consistent look and feel. I have added Rechart so that user can easily check and track sells and other business information. Login authentication is added with react firebase hooks. For social login, user can login with google or facebook.

I have used Node.js express and MongoDB for server site. The server site is hosted on Heroku. 

I have attached both client and server site link bellow.
